# 📒 My Learning:

### ✏️  CSS  Selectors :

+ `.panel > *` selects all elements whose parent   have panel class

### ✏️  Cubic-beizer in transition :
```css
transition:
font-size 0.7s cubic-bezier(0.61,-0.19, 0.7,-0.11),
flex 0.7s cubic-bezier(0.61,-0.19, 0.7,-0.11),
```

### ✏️ Use of `transitioned` :

+ `transitionend` event can make sure all the animations are done before the next action starts.
